# SnowFall_Analysis
Comparative analysis of historical snowfall patterns using big data technologies and ArcGIS visualization. Conducted by Earth.ai team at UCR

Group Name:

**Abstract**:
A significant amount of weather data is generated by multiple weather stations and reported to government datasets. In this project, we aim to conduct a comparative analysis of the historical patterns of snowfall data using big data technologies and visualize it using ArcGIS. This analysis will provide meaningful insights from the vast data and predict the snowfall pattern using ML algorithms. Snowfall and snowstorms have significant impacts, and understanding their patterns can be crucial for various applications.

**Data Processing**:
We utilized the NOAA Global Surface dataset, which is based on Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) data. This dataset comprises data from 9000 stations worldwide. We used data from 2001-2019, focusing on attributes like temperature, wind speed, mean dew point, precipitation, and weather station location.

**Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:**
The dataset was divided into two parts: weather data and mapping. The mapping data associated station numbers with their specific latitude and longitude. Data cleaning involved removing junk values and finding correlations between various entities. The final dataset was integrated using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.

**Conclusion:**
The results from this project provided a comparative analysis of historical snowfall patterns using big data technologies. We visualized the data using ArcGIS, showcasing snowfall predictions for multiple years. This project can be expanded further to include global datasets for a worldwide snowfall prediction.
